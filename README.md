# Viewer
This app lets you get your naughty on by downloading images from e621.net.

## Installation
Apple doesn't like apps that allow you to access porn directly. Consequently the installation process is somewhat challenging. I know you can do it though. :wink:

### Ingredients
* Mac OS X 10.10 or greater
* 1 Freshly installed version of Xcode 7, available for free on the Mac App Store
* 1 Apple Developer Account, or an Apple ID
* 1 [Download of ViewerApp](https://github.com/ViewerApp/ViewerApp/archive/master.zip), unzipped.

### Instructions
First, mix the build ingredients together. Batter may be slightly lumpy.

1. Open the "viewer.xcworkspace" file in Xcode.
2. Open Xcode > Preferences > Accounts, and add your Developer Account or Apple ID credentials.
3. Select the project by clicking the blueprint at the top of the left pane, then select the "General" tab in the main window
4. Add a random word to the end of the Bundle Identifier.
5. A couple spaces under the Bundle ID field, you should see a field named "Team". Change that from "None" to your Developer Account or Apple ID

While the batter chills, connect your iPhone or iPod.
Once you've done that, go to Product > Destination and select your device.
When you're ready to make Viewer yours, click the play button and watch as the project is built and installed to your device.

That's it! You can disconnect your device and use the app as much as you'd like.

**Don't delete Xcode from your computer! You'll need it if you want to install updates to the app.**
